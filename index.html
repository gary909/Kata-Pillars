        There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the <br>
        width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:<br>
        <br>
        number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);<br>
        distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);<br>
        width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).<br>
        Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without <br>
        the width of the first and last pillar).<br>
